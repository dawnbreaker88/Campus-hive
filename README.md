## Introduction

Welcome to Campus-hive! 🐝 This project aims to connect university students, making it easier to find study groups 📚, discover campus events 🎉, and share experiences 🗣️. It is built using React and Vite, leveraging modern web development practices for a fast and efficient development experience.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 18)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev

    └── ...
    ## Dependencies

The project relies on the following key dependencies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint:** A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

> List any other major dependencies and their purpose (e.g., React Router for navigation, Axios for API requests).  Include version numbers.

## ESLint Configuration

This project uses ESLint to enforce code style and quality. The ESLint configuration is located in `.eslintrc.cjs`. It includes rules for:

- Possible Errors
- Best Practices
- Stylistic Issues
- React-specific rules

> Specify any custom ESLint rules or configurations that are important for contributors to know. For example:
> - We use the `airbnb` style guide with some modifications.
> - All React components must have prop types defined.

## React Plugins: @vitejs/plugin-react vs. @vitejs/plugin-react-swc

Vite provides two official plugins for React projects, each offering different approaches to Fast Refresh:

### @vitejs/plugin-react

- Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- Mature and widely adopted.
- Good choice for projects already using Babel or requiring specific Babel transformations.
- Configuration is done through `.babelrc` or `babel.config.js`.

### @vitejs/plugin-react-swc

- Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
- SWC is a Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools.
- Offers significantly faster build times compared to Babel.
- Suitable for projects seeking performance improvements and not relying on specific Babel transformations.
- Generally recommended for new projects due to its speed.

**When to use which:**

- Use `@vitejs/plugin-react` if you need Babel transformations or have an existing Babel configuration.
- Use `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for faster build times and a more modern toolchain, especially for new projects.

## Deployment

To deploy the project, follow these steps:

1. Build the project using `npm run build`.
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` directory to your web server.

> Specify any specific deployment configurations or steps, e.g., using Netlify, Vercel, or Docker.
> For example:
> - Deploy to Netlify by connecting your GitHub repository.
> - Use Docker to containerize the application and deploy to a container registry.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to Campus-hive! To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with clear and descriptive commit messages.
4. Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

> Add any specific contribution guidelines, such as coding style, testing requirements, or code review process.
> For example:
> - All code must be tested before submission.
> - Follow the existing coding style.
> - Ensure your code passes ESLint checks.
